    <p class="p">My name is Carson, I am a Junior at PHS. I like playing basketball with my friends, and skating. My favorite food is probably a cheesesteak and my favorite color is probably green. I am 16 years old, I was born in Seattle, WA but I grew up in SF and then moved to the bay shortly after. Make sure to check out the wordle too if you are interested in that sort of thing. Thanks for checking out my website and taking a minute to read a bit about me! </p>
