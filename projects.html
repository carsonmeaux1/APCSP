    <p class="p">my first project was volunteering for Glide Community Church, where I helped serve food to many of the homeless within San Francisco. It was a great group of people, amd it felt good helping people in need even if it was something small and simple.</p>

    <p class="p">This project was something I did in physics class this year. We had to make the most speed and weight efficient car with only cheap and reusable materials. This was a good team building and innovative project that I worked on with my friends in class.</p>
